# 🍽️ Weekly Menu Planner

A shared meal planner and grocery list generator for busy humans who just want dinner to be easier.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

Me and Leah were always having the same conversation:  
> *"What should we do for dinner?"*  
Then we'd go to the store and somehow still forget half of what we needed.

This app is our fix — a simple, shared place to plan meals for the week and get a complete grocery list without the chaos.

## ✨ What It Does

- 📚 Choose meals from your personal meal list  
- 📆 Assign meals to specific days on a weekly calendar  
- 🛒 Auto-generate a grocery list from your planned meals  
- ✍️ Add, edit, and delete meals anytime  
- 👥 Supports multiple users — perfect for households and partners  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Firebase (Firestore + Auth) for syncing across users  
- Custom-built calendar view (no FullCalendar)  
- Responsive design for desktop & mobile use  

## 🚀 Features

- **Searchable Meal Library** – Quickly find your go-to dinners  
- **Drag-to-Assign Calendar View** – Plan your week in seconds  
- **Shared Grocery List** – One list for everyone in your household  
- **Multi-User Support** – Sign in and collaborate with your partner or roomies
